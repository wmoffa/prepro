                    <p>How are those "Free Leads" working? Nothing is "Free" especially when you're loosing all that money on
                        Print and Postage! Don't be fooled by receiving tired old lists that have been previously sold to
                        other clients in your market area.</p>

                    <p>What we do differently is compile our own lists and identify prospects that have "fallen through the
                        cracks" and are not under everyone else's radar.
                        <p>
