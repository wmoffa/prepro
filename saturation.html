                            the country?</h2>
                        <p>Our address file is updated every month in conjunction with the U.S. Post Office, making it the freshest,
                            most deliverable mailing list available. Our clients have the ability to order addresses by Carrier
                            Route, ZIP, County or State.</p>
                        <p>Our Resident-Occupant file contains names of residents where available. Records are addressed to
                            "Resident" or "Occupant" at an address where the name is not known. It is ideal for saturation
                            mailings, especially since this list qualifies for the lowest available postal rates. This list
                            is fully "walk sequenced", which is the lowest postage rate available from the Post Office. This
                            means the records are delivered to you in the same sequence the mail carrier delivers the mail.
                            Since we have done much of the sorting work for the Post Office, the post office passes its cost
                            savings on to you</p>
